## Team Stats
In the game of hockey, points by a player is one of the most important things. A point is described as either a goal or an assist. The more points a player has, generally the better they are. During the 2024-25 season, **Robert Thomas** led the club in points with 81.

Of the 81 points **Thomas** had, only 21 came from goals. By this, you can tell that **Thomas** isn't the main scorer on the team, he is the facilitator. **Thomas's** favorite players to assist were **Jordan Kyrou** and **Pavel Buchnevich**, both with 9. This is not a surprise since this trio was the top line for St. Louis during the 24-25 season. This will likely change this season with **Kyrou** being swapped out of the top line for **Jimmy Snuggerud**.
